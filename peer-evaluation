Peer's repository: https://github.com/matalin608/03-Text-adventure



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 - Through my peer's code, I learned how to utilize 'open' as a verb and have the contents inside actually just play the role of another location. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 - I really liked the idea of getting an item (key) in order to fully escape the threat downstairs. I would likely apply the use of more items and collectables in my future games. 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 - Though the game file didn't require much commenting, it's never harmful to add even a little. 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

  - A lot of this was rather straightforward, so I don't really believe it required much better commenting than was already written.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

  - Nope, I thought the code was clear and concise!

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

  - Yes, this repository contains an appropriate LICENSE

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 - Honestly, the README was very descriptive and I can't really think of anything they could add. (maybe a part about quitting at the end?)

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

 - I genuinely thought this was a fun and creative text-adventure game. Great job :^)
